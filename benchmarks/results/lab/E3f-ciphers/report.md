# E3f-ciphers

On the Pi, AES-GCM is cheaper than ChaCha20 and makes byte-bound copies faster for both tools.

- Kind: screening. Primary metric: `wall_s`. Control arm: `xs`.
- Smallest effect of interest: 3%. Interval level: 95.0%.
- Runs: 20261014T220708Z-E3f-ciphers.
- Valid blocks: 0. Voided block attempts: 0.

## Ratio to the control

Time of the arm divided by time of the control in the same block; below 1 is faster. The interval is the paired t interval; the robust column is the Hodges-Lehmann estimate with its distribution-free interval.

| Cell | Arm | Blocks | Ratio | Robust | p | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

This is a screening experiment: the p-values are unadjusted and nothing here is a claim. A candidate is re-measured in a confirmatory run.

## Absolute `wall_s`

Geometric mean over valid blocks, in seconds.
